    <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a St. Louis native who graduated from Saint Louis University in May of 2017 with a major in Communication and a focus in Advertising, as well as a minor in Visual Communication.  In my spare time, I enjoy sketching and digital art, and restoring old and black and white photos. I joined Savvy Coders in August of 2016 as an intern, and I have been working in the company ever since. Handling marketing and graphic design duties, as well as lending a hand wherever possible, I love to see Savvy Coders and its students grow.</p>
    <h2>My Six Weeks With Savvy Coders' Course</h2>
    <p>It's been over a year since I started working with Savvy Coders. When I started as an intern while I was a student in August of 2015, Elaine asked me what I wanted to get out of working for her and Savvy Coders. I told her the main thing I wanted to get out of it was gaining real world experience working for a company. Learning in class was nice, but did not always provide me with all the knowledge and skills that I felt were important to having a successful career. My position and responsibilities within the company have changed quite a bit with time, and I have met many great people, seen lots of graduates gain fascinating skills and great jobs, and so much more. Savvy Coders has always been a place where I learned to apply my classroom skills into the "real world", and now as a student of the course things are no different. Not only did I gain the skills I expected, but I learned how to apply them well and practically to build something meaningful and useful.</p>
    <p>In my six weeks in Savvy Coders' course, I have learned many skills, not only in computer programming, but in many things that I didn't even think about learning.</p>
    <p>Here's some of the major skills I learned and others I improved through Savvy Coders' course:</p>
    <ul id="a-list">
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>Time Management</li>
      <li>Organization</li>
      <li>Listening Skills</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now that I have graduated from Savvy Coders' course, I am greatly looking forward to continuing my work within the company, and also to the opportunites I may have the chance to gain in the future.</p>
